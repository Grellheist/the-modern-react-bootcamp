# Some React annotations

These annotations are going to be taken during the "The Modern React Bootcamp"
course on Udemy.

Some of the Sections in this repo won't have code written by me, just the
materials provided by the instructor.

The plan is to eventually migrate my portfolio to NextJS, and it will be done
at the end of this course.
